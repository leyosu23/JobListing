### Hi there, my name's Yoonseop Lee, a candidate for Lumaki Labs Inc. in the position of Full Stack Software Developer Co-op.


●	Description - short explanation (bullet points) on what the api should do

-  Post Request  will create job postings
-  Put Request will update the posting position information with given value
-  Delete Request will remove a job posting.
-  Get Request will get multiple job postings made so far.

●	Getting Started - how to reproduce it on local and system requirements

-  Basically, there is need of running front-end and back-end respectively 
### 🚨 But node_modules is missing for front-end and is essential to run this.
-  "npm install" on client directory (cd client) on cmd to install node_module
-  "npm start" on client directory (cd client) on cmd to run front-end
-  "npm run devStart" on server directory (cd server) on cmd to run back-end

●	Features - descriptions of endpoints (bullet points) to interact with your api

- Post Request : http://localhost:3001/insert
- Put Request : http://localhost:3001/update
- Delete Request : http://localhost:3001/delete/:id
    *id needs to certain value
- Get Request : http://localhost:3001/read

●	Roadmap (Optional) - future updates, upgrades, implementations, or whatever else you would want your API to do if you continue to work on it.

- I has not been working on SECURITY option to register/login
